If you prefer, you can copy and paste the code here, and I’d be happy to help analyze it! What kind of code is it—deep learning for handwritten digit recognition? That sounds like a fascinating AI application.

Here’s how you can perform Visualization of Results and Extract Model Insights for your handwritten digit recognition project: --- 1. Plot Training and Validation Accuracy/Loss Visualize model performance over epochs. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Accuracy plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Train Accuracy') plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Val Accuracy') plt.title('Model Accuracy') plt.xlabel('Epoch') plt.ylabel('Accuracy') plt.legend() plt.show() # Loss plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Train Loss') plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Val Loss') plt.title('Model Loss') plt.xlabel('Epoch') plt.ylabel('Loss') plt.legend() plt.show() --- 2. Confusion Matrix Understand which digits the model confuses most often. import numpy as np from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay y_pred = model.predict(x_test) y_pred_classes = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1) y_true = np.argmax(y_test, axis=1) cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred_classes) disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm, display_labels=range(10)) disp.plot(cmap=plt.cm.Blues) plt.title("Confusion Matrix") plt.show() --- 3. Visualize Some Predictions Show predictions for a few test images. plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) for i in range(10): plt.subplot(2, 5, i + 1) plt.imshow(x_test[i].reshape(28, 28), cmap='gray') plt.title(f"Pred: {y_pred_classes[i]}, True: {y_true[i]}") plt.axis('off') plt.tight_layout() plt.show() --- 4. Identify Misclassified Digits Helpful for improving the model. misclassified_idx = np.where(y_pred_classes != y_true)[0] plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) for i in range(10): idx = misclassified_idx[i] plt.subplot(2, 5, i + 1) plt.imshow(x_test[idx].reshape(28, 28), cmap='gray') plt.title(f"Pred: {y_pred_classes[idx]}, True: {y_true[idx]}") plt.axis('off') plt.tight_layout() plt.show() --- 5. Model Insights High Accuracy on simple digits like 1, 7, 0. Confusion commonly occurs between similar-looking digits like 5 & 3, or 9 & 4. Drop in Validation Accuracy may suggest overfitting; use regularization/dropout/augmentation. --- Let me know if you'd like to include Grad-CAM or filter visualizations for deeper interpretability.
Great job including visualization methods for assessing model performance and interpretability! Your approach provides valuable insights into training dynamics, prediction confidence, and areas where the model struggles.

Would you like to explore additional techniques, like Grad-CAM for identifying which parts of an image influenced a prediction, or filter visualizations to understand how convolutional layers process digit features? These could offer deeper interpretability and potential improvements for your AI application.
